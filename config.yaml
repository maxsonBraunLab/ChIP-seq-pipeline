title: "GSK x Quiz treatment with MOLM13 cells at 24 hours"

intro: "We are looking to do some drug combination studies with GSK and Quizartinib to treat MOLM13 cells which have FLT3-ITD mutations."

takeaways:
  - "All samples look good with no obvious batch effect."
  - "Consensus peaks looked okay. Number of consensus peaks per factor would be ranked: LSD1 > MYC >> RUNX."
  - "Very few DE peaks for MYC and RUNX across all contrasts; LSD1 had about 50 DE peaks."

notes: "We answered these questions, and look forward to answering more."

analysis:
  - "Align reads with bowtie1"
  - "Make tracks + generate bigBed files, mark duplicates, remove unmapped reads"
  - "Call peaks with MACS2 using bigBed files. Control sample is IgG split by condition and replicate."
  - "Take consensus peaks with custom R script and generate"
